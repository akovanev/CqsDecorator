# CqsDecorator

## Preamble

While I was trying to use [Scrutor](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor) for one of my projects, I got stuck on the [Open-generic registrations can not be decorated](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor/issues/39) issue.

As Scrutor looks very attractive to me and I wouldn't like to give up, I have desided to find a workaround.

## Important

This project is far from ideal, even without checking the arguments, it is just an attempt to point the direction.
